The importance of cyber security in eduction.

#1 Why schould schools care?
There are many reasons why schools should take cybersecurity seriously. If the school gets DDOSed then no work depending on internet 
conectivity will be done. The information of students being leaked is very bad for public perception. If the infromation of staff member 
gets leaked then the chances of someone wanting to work at the school in question go down. If an account of a student/staff member gets
hacked then the account can be used to cause further damage. Including but not limited to: full access to all information on students and staff,
changing the code behind related websites, and damage to hardware. 

#2 Misconceptions about cyber security
1)
Most children don't even know how networking works. How could they possibly do anything listed above?
Cybersecurity is about stoping bad actors regardless of age from interfering from the daily operation.

2)
A strong password will stop any threat.
As computers grow more and more powerfull with every passing year it has become more viable to use "brute force password cracking". Which is
the act is breaking passwords by guessing the password. Which is why mesures like passkeys and 2 factor athentication have bcome more populare
in recent years.

3)
Cybersecurity costs more then it's worth.
Damage to even 5 SSDs is more money then the price of 1 cybersecurity auditor highered to prevent such damage.

4)
The school I worked for never got hacked so I shouldn't care.
Everything that can go wron will go wrong given enough time. 

#3 How to improve cybersecurity
1) Never relly on one security solution. It is like trying to prevent a bank robbery by having only locked doors.
2) Do not use obscure software. The more obscure the software is the more likely it has security issues the developers are unaware of.
3) Train school staff to not trust any emails (or any other forms of communication) by default.
4) Reduce the software footprint. Software may have flaws that allow for normal user to run in admin mode and as a result download malware.
5) Do not provide devices/users with more rights then the bare minimum to get work done.
6) Isolate devices from each other on the network based on who needs access to them. Such that student computers can not interact with server computers.
7) Do not connect devices to the network unless they need it for operation. Printers that are intended for the secretary to use should not need internet access if it is already connected to the pc via usb.
8) Password protect the BIOS/EUFI of devices. This will prevent bad actors from being able to boot an OS from a usb drive which cercomvents most secretary mesures.

#4 Common terms
CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It can be thought of as a fancy term for exploit/vulnerability.
Malware is malicous software. Even though malware and virus are used interchangeably they aren't the same.
Virus is a specific type of malware that infects files as a means to sbread. 
Worm is a specific type of malware that
