The importance of cyber security in eduction.

#1 Why schould schools care?
There are many reasons why schools should take cybersecurity seriously. If the school gets DDOSed then no work depending on internet 
conectivity will be done. The information of students being leaked is very bad for public perception. If the infromation of staff member 
gets leaked then the chances of someone wanting to work at the school in question go down. If an account of a student/staff member gets
hacked then the account can be used to cause further damage. Including but not limited to: full access to all information on students and staff,
changing the code behind related websites, and damage to hardware. 

#2 Misconceptions about cyber security
Most children don't even know how networking works. How could they possibly do anything listed above?
Cybersecurity is about stoping bad actors regardless of age from interfering from the daily operation.

A strong password will stop any threat.
As computers grow more and more powerfull with every passing year it has become more viable to use "brute force password cracking". Which is
the act is breaking passwords by guessing the password. Which is why mesures like passkeys and 2 factor athentication have bcome more populare
in recent years.

Cybersecurity costs more then it's worth.
Damage to even 5 SSDs is more money then the price of 1 cybersecurity auditor highered to prevent such damage.

The school I worked for never got hacked so I shouldn't care.
Everything that can go wron will go wrong given enough time.
