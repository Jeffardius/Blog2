There are many reasons why schools should take cybersecurity seriously. If the school gets DDOSed then no work depending on internet 
conectivity will be done. The information of students being leaked is very bad for public perception. If the infromation of staff member 
gets leaked then the chances of someone wanting to work at the school in question go down. If an account of a student/staff member gets
hacked then the account can be used to cause further damage. Including but not limited to: full access to all information on students and staff,
changing the code behind related websites, and damage to hardware.
