1) Never relly on one security solution. It is like trying to prevent a bank robbery by having only locked doors.
2) Do not use obscure software. The more obscure the software is the more likely it has security issues the developers are unaware of.
3) Train school staff to not trust any emails (or any other forms of communication) by default.
4) Reduce the software footprint. Software may have flaws that allow for normal user to run in admin mode and as a result download malware.
5) Do not provide devices/users with more rights then the bare minimum to get work done.
6) Isolate devices from each other on the network based on who needs access to them. Such that student computers can not interact with server computers.
7) Do not connect devices to the network unless they need it for operation. Printers that are intended for the secretary to use should not need internet access if it is already connected to the pc via usb.
8) Password protect the BIOS/EUFI of devices. This will prevent bad actors from being able to boot an OS from a usb drive which cercomvents most secretary mesures.
