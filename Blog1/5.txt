Yet another exmaple of how a optimism bias could effect actions is an employee 
storing all work related passwords in an unencrypted txt file in the desktop folder
named passwords.txt. When asked the employee responds with "I am not even a server
admin what could possibly go wrong if I get hacked". Unaware that the account(s)
will be used to send out phishing emails or probe for other holes in the protections
inplace. Such as checking for accounts being given more rights then needed. Leading
to a lot of time waisted for the cyber security department.
