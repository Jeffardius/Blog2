An example of Confirmation bias would be an employee beliving in outdated studies
showing that OpenBSD is "the most secure OS". Leading to them not knowing that the
attempt to support 14* diferent cpu archutextures leads to slower development and
thus patches for CVEs being rolled out slower then other l/unix OSes. The OpenBSD
team also maintains other important projects like OpenSSH, OpenSSL, and many other
networking tools. Since these tools also support the same CPUs that OpenBSD does
they are also slow to update. While OpenBSD is still one of the most secure OSes
it is not flawless and the employee ignores any critasism as "linux fanboyism".
Only reading articales talking about what makes OpenBSD so wonderfull and never
what flaws it has and why other OSes are better given certain situations.
