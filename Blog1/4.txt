Optimism bias will lead to an expert beliving that the system is "impossible to crack".
Not knowing that if something can it will happen. Or that if it is cracked that nothing
major will happen.

For example the codebase for a company being rewriten in rust from c/c++ leading to a 
system being "effectivally unbreakable" (70% of security issues in apps a result of
memory management errors that are impossible in rust). Dismissing the fact that 70%
is not the same as 100% and the fact that code errors are not the entire picture when 
it comes to cyber security. Not to mentions that no tool is perfect. Even if it is
recommended by the FBI.
