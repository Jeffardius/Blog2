The best way to deal with any bias in cyber security that can scew the judgement of
an expert in the field is to remember the war between security and hacking is not a 
match of league of legends. It is a continues never ending war. Not a one of event 
totally isolated form the rest of the world. Undescovered hardware vualnrabilities 
may be inside all the hardware the organization makes use of. 

A war has many fronts and just beacuse the software front is "100% secure" does not 
mean every front is. Physical security is also a factor as what a bad actor with 
physical acess to a machine skyrockets. Humans are not perfect cretures and we all
make mistakes eventually. A server admin acidentally forgetting to disable the 
root account in a l/unix server could be disasterous as the root user has FULL
UNIMITGATED access to the entire system.

This is why to reduce the strnaglehold that biases can have over your choices
in the workplace one should:
1) Not to be afraid of being wrong.
2) Avoid partaking in/creating echo chambers.
3) Should be ok with concepts they are familuar with becoming outdated/deprecated.
4) Be open to other's perspectives/solutions.
5) Design systems with human error in mind.
6) Go of tests not just past experiance.
7) Seak out constructive & good fath arguments with peopl of oposing/conflicting views.
8) Stay in touch with cyber security news.
9) Inform others on how them lacking security effects others in the workplace.
10) Treat no source as the objective truth. The turth often has hidden conditions for it to be "true".
11) Humans are not without flaws and thus can not make flawless things.
